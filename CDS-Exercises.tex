\section*{Questions}

Each supervision is split into three sections:

\begin{description}
\item[Bookwork] \hfill\\
  This section focuses on the key concepts you need to understand and
  remember to do well in the course. It's not worth including these
  definitions in your answers, but they should be on the tip of your
  tongue if you're asked about them in a supervision! If there is
  anything here you don't understand please send me an email, so that
  we can address it in advance and you can take the most out of the
  supervision.
\item[Exercises] \hfill\\
  This is where I expect you to spend most of your time and effort. If
  you get stuck on a question, move onto the others and come back to
  it later. If you're still stuck, either send me an email or leave a
  note to discuss during the supervision.
\item[Extensions] \hfill\\
  If you have some spare time or interest after finishing the core
  exercises, have a look at the extensions. They cover topics that are
  just beyond the scope of the course, so attempting these questions
  is optional. However, spending some time here will give you a deeper
  understanding of the course, which will be helpful later.
\end{description}


\section*{Submitting work}

Submit your answers to the questions as a single PDF file \todo{email
  address?}. I am rarely in Cambridge so I can't accept paper
submissions. I strongly suggest using LaTeX to typeset your answers
--- you'll need it next year for your dissertation, and the sooner you
start practicing the better.

The sooner you submit work the more time I have to mark it and give
detailed feedback. Aim to submit your work 48 hours before the
corresponding supervision. If for some reason you can't do that,
please let me know not to wait for it. I am happy to mark work
submitted after a supervision in exceptional circumstances, but keep
in mind that you'll be missing out on most of the benefit of the
supervision.

\section*{General advice}

In Cambridge, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by all the work to be
done, and like your supervisors expect your life to revolve around
work. They don't, and it shouldn't. Take care of your physical and
mental health first, and then your work.

If you're struggling, let your relevant supervisors, DoS and Tutor know
so that they can help. \todo{Maybe include a link to a student
  helpline?}

Lastly, enjoy learning through these questions!
